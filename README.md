> Naval Battles (full title â€” Naval Battles: World War II on the High Seas) is a turn-based, card-driven wargame based on naval combat during World War II. Designed by Dan Verssen and published by Phalanx Games, the game is playable by 2 or more players, each commanding a fleet with the objective of sinking a certain amount of their opponents' ships.

> Each player arranges an initial fleet, with each ship represented by a card. A reserve fleet is also arranged available to join the battle later as needed. Additionally, there is a deck of action cards the player draws from. In the process of their turn, a player plays cards to fire weapons and take other actions. Attack actions are usually related to a specific type of weapon mount, as detailed on the ship card. To use the attack card, the player must have a ship with the appropriate weapon mount listed. Cards may also be played by other players to defend their ships from attack.
